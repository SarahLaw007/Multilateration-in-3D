# Multilateration-in-3D
You are to implement the function named multilaterate(distances) in the provided template python code in the file multilaterate.py. The function multilaterate(distances) takes a list of lists as its input. The list should have four landmark locations with associated (x, y, z, d) in formation in which x, y, z are the location of the landmark in 3D and d is the distance of the landmark to the unknown point to be localized. You should test your program to ensure it works with different input points correctly. Your program will be tested on several different setups and should provide reasonable output (i.e. for each coordinate of (x, y, z), either the absolute or relative error is less than 10 âˆ’6 ). multilaterate.py takes a single argument: the datafile name. Your program should then print out the location that is computed. A skeleton multilaterate.py is provided. For your submission, besides the implementation, you need to provide a PDF file placed in the same folder to explain your implementation, i.e., how do you compute the location. This does not need to too mathematical, i.e., you can use mostly verbal descriptions to explain the main ideas behind your computation.
